Between the 3rd and the 7th of April 2014, I was in İstanbul for the 15th National Selection Conference of [EYP Turkey.][eypturkey]

All of it started on a Thursday, three months ago. My English teacher Serap Sarı in the Bornova Anatolian High School told me that our teachers were looking for a few students to participate in an European Youth Parliament session in İstanbul, and she recommended me to the teachers. She asked me if I wanted to join the team or not.

At first, I hesitated - because I tend to be lazy sometimes - but let's skip this part. The teachers in charge of our school's EYP team turned out to be Meryem Yazıcı and Canan Güzel, our lovely biology teachers. They are really caring people who deserve great appreciation. They helped us on the way to İstanbul, in İstanbul, and back to İzmir.

So, the first day in İstanbul was quite dull until we went to Kabataş Erkek Lisesi and checked in. There were people from many parts of Turkey, meeting and greeting each other. We walked to Yıldız Park in Beşiktaş, for "Teambuilding".

From left to right, you see Gustaf Danielsson, the President of our session, and Head Organizers Onur Can Uçarer and Tamer Özgen. We met them all in a quick introduction. On the picture, third from the far right, in a blue hoodie, you can see Inna Scherbyna - the chairperson of SEDE (Committee on Security and Defense). We met her in ten minutes or so, after gathering with the committee in a secluded part of the park. Maybe that was our worst decision that day. We missed the chance of taking part in the following video. :D

So we played a few games that helped us remember each others names, traits, etc. We also met Lindi Lila, our hardworking journo. You can see his magic on [Horizon Media Team's webpage.][horizonmediateam]

I'll never forget the games. I've always loved playing games, and I hadn't played games for a very long time, so I made the most of it in the teambuilding. :) Inna and Lindi taught us about 10-15 games. The games were so addictive, I mean, we played it during the breaks, when Inna was away, when we were on the streets, when we were in our hotel rooms, and, in İzmir, I taught a few games to my friends at school, and played the games a few times.

So... as we were in a mostly secluded part of the park, there were animals all around us. We saw a lot of beautiful squirrels - they really distracted us sometimes! We also played the game "Ninja" a lot, so we named our committee as "Ninja Squirrels", and that sort of became an internal joke.

We had all sorts of people in our committee. Metehan was a card game enthusiast, so he had brought a deck to dinner. Deniz was also interested in games, so they started playing card games. Then I joined. Then Lindi did, and he began teaching us a VERY, VERY complex card game which seems to be very popular in Albania. We were interrupted by some important announcement, so I never got to understand the game. If I ever see Lindi again, I'll teach him "Papazkaçtı", and see his reaction. :P

On the second day, the hardwork began. I never thought I'd use a Post-It in my life, but I did. I also had to use flipcharts, and sit in a circle - I'd only see this in movies! But it happened. First thing I learned in EYP was the importance of Post-It cards. We began discussing, gathering information, and discovering problems. My committee was really good, almost everybody would have a say in discussions, there was a lot of talking, etc. It felt like I was in a real committee (and it should be that way. I perceived EYP as some sort of a funny, a lesser European Parliament simulation). Sometimes I would portray the kid in myself, for example, when we played that cat game in which you meow to your committee friends and ask them to pet you without smiling, and sometimes, when we needed to, I would return to my 16-year-old self trying to solve the problems with today's Europe.

Coffee breaks were mostly amazing.

And the Bosphorus tour. People were dancing to loud music, and people who hadn't met each other would do it there. People were hungry and they cheered for pizza. Inna was mostly silent, watching İstanbul. I went to her, asking, "do you want to know how I can tell most people here are from İstanbul?", she said yes, and I explained: "none of them are looking outside". She agreed, and that was the truth. Only a few watched the view.

[![boat party][eyp2]][eyp2]

And then something weird happened - I met a guy named Berkay. Then a guy named Berke joined us. (My name is Berk.) We started looking around for people and reading their name tags for anything containing "Berk". We found Ardaberk and Berksu. One day, I'll do that somewhere else, gather all the Berks and hang out like a gang. We felt like a community. :p

I met a few other chairs and orgas. It all started with a dialogue with Love Lyssarides. He was rather tall and I asked him if I can compare my hand to his. He almost fell down the boat after seeing my hand. (I know, my hand is quite an icebreaker). Then everybody joined to compare hands (Chairs of other committees, Katie Pennick, Natalia Vagena, Anna Zellweger, etc.) I told Love that I knew a couple of Swedish words, and told him the story of the word "kalabalik" (and that it came from Turkish). He was impressed. I asked him if he knew of the band Änglagård and got a no. (which part of Sweden r u livin in m8?)

Berksu Gündüz (another BAL graduate) joined us in the conversation. The orgas and I chit-chatted on how GA works, and took a photo.

[![chairs and orgas][eyp4]][eyp4]

So, the morning of General Assembly day - I woke up to the delicate sound of a schoolmate trying to wake me up - we were kind of late! We got prepared really quickly and went to Akatlar Kültür Merkezi for the show. Everybody is in formal dressing, waiting for the GA session. At the end of the day, our resolution didn't pass, but we were not upset at all - we contributed to the debates regarding other committees and remained active. (Well, Hasan, a friend of mine from the committee got a little angry at times, but we both agreed that it looked really fun. In our countries general assemblies, people often attack each other, punch each other, throw iPads on people's faces, etc. so we added our touch of "realism" to the game. :p Don't worry, no one got hurt.)

[![singing][eyp3]][eyp3]

I believe I was also active during the session. Speaking into a microphone didn't look scary, so I took the floor a few times to state my opinion. I had experiences from debates in İzmir, but this one, you're speaking to a crowd of almost 150 delegates... It was an unique experience and I took away a lot from it.

I thought that I did not like the sound of French until I heard some people speaking in French during the GA. I never felt the urge of learning a language ever strong before. :(

[![last photo][eyp5]][eyp5]

Anyway, so the session got officially closed by the President. You can view all of the photographs and videos in [this page][horizonmediateam].

Then we went to Babylon, in Beyoğlu, for the farewell party. The music was very loud. This was one of the funniest highlights for me, that day: I was mostly silent and away from the crowd. Then I began thinking about my social life. I certainly did look awkward just doing that. I didn't like that situation. I went to Gustaf, and told him this, "I've never been in a party like this before. I never danced, and I don't know how to". So he showed me how to. I said, "this is harder than EYP itself. Is this really the comfort zone you were talking about, that we needed to break?". He nodded, agreeing. I went downstairs and for one moment, covered all of my prejudices with a blanket and made nonsensical moves, apparently dancing. (Yeah, at least I have some sort of an experience right now. At least I know that I don't like dancing.)

And it all ended, we returned home. When Inna returned her homeland, she informed us that some other parts of Ukraine are in clash. To quote her,

> EYP is the world without problems. When you return from EYP, problems begin to appear.

I can't agree more to that. The sense of a community (in EYP) makes those problems disappear. Maybe it's what makes this experience unique. It was one of my best weeks in my life. In four days, I gained memories that could fill an entire year.

*Edit:* Apparently, I was selected for the European Youth Parliament's 77th International Session in Kiev (among with 8 others from Turkey). However, due to the recent events in Ukraine, the session has been cancelled, so instead I will be participating the 9th International Youth Forum in İstanbul between the 6th and 11th of May! :)
