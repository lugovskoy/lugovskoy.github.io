To everyone claiming that mathematics are based on strict rules, it is universal, and it is objective, meaning, one can never deny {% m %} 2 + 2 = 4 {% em %}, since it has been mathematically proven, etc.

You make comparisions between mathematics and {arts, philosophy, ...}, telling that mathematics do not allow for personal opinions because of the ruleset, etc. When you need to give an example for the "unprovable-ness" of artistic or philosophical statements, you attack mathematics first, even go as far as telling that it is absolutely not art.

This is an insult to every mathematician ever.

The misconception is, that the mathematical rules (axioms) are like laws that mathematicians must obey. It has never been that way.

You actually get to choose which ruleset (axiomatic system) to adhere to. You can pick your own rules and play according to them. It is exactly your job to determine your foundations.

Peano, for example, created a work of art when he axiomatized the natural numbers. In that process, he didn't have to use anything other than axiomatic set theory and axiom of induction. It's like borrowing your friends Bob's and Alice's rules for a few moments to create your own, based on a few of their ideas.

What about the notation? Do I actually have to write my ideas out in a formal way with Greek letters and symbols? ... well, if I have to publish it, then yes I do, but it's just a matter of "common language". While learning set theory, the students' main focus shouldn't be learning the letters. Their main focus should be learning the ideas, the underlying principles.

Now {% m %} 2 + 2 = 4 {% em %} (the most clich√© example ever) looks like just lines and curves on a paper, right? It should be. You can never know what I meant writing that line. What if I actually intended to give an obscure message to the readers?

Mathematics are as artistic as paintings, music, or as thoughtful as the deepest philosophical question ever. I'm pretty sure that a painter wouldn't like me to comment on his painting of a fish, saying "this doesn't look like a fish at all." Thank you for reading.
