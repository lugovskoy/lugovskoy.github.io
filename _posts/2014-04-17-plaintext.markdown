I already have written [Flashcard][flashcard] to help me memorize stuff. I keep my to-do list in a plaintext file. I write my blog posts in plaintext files. I keep my school schedule, my calendar, etc. on plaintext files.

Today I made a decision: I'm going to move whatever I have to plaintext. My notebooks, diaries -- everything. I'm going to sit for a few hours and type it all into my computer, and organize it in directories.

I'm doing this, because I've already seen the power of tools such as `awk`, `perl`, etc. Unix was built on top of this philosophy - you'd keep everything in plaintext files and work on them with powerful tools. Some people prefer using org-mode in Emacs, but I just couldn't move away from Vim.

Let's see how this goes.

*N.B. Remind me to rewrite Flashcard one day.*
