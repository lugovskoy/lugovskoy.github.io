I've been trying to familiarize myself with Audacity for the last two days, so I composed two little pieces, experimenting with what I could do. Not too much, but I've had a lot of fun while doing this.

I admit that I have something for Brownian noise. It musically satisfies my ears in a way that nothing else does.

You may download the tracks individually below, in their respective sections. Or you can download the full album:

## Ninninin değili

The title is the Turkish for "not lullaby". It is an ambient, noisy piece of electronic music in sonata form (inspired by Miles Davis' In a Silent Way). It is dedicated to my friend Onur Yavuz.

## Fourier: I. Serim / II. Düğüm / III. Düğüm / IV. Düğüm

The title is the Turkish for "Fourier: I. Exposition / II. Knot / III. Knot / IV. Knot". Compared to the first track, it is more present. It contains samples from the first track, and a click track that goes on for the entire track. It is dedicated to mathematician Joseph Fourier, and my friend Gülce Kardeş.
