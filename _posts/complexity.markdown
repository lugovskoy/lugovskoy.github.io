[Determining the Complexity of a Musical Rhythm][original] is a beautiful article written by an 18-year old computer science enthusiast (we have so much in common!) nicknamed [{% m %} SSO \Delta {% em %}][ssodelta]. I think that this is a very interesting topic to talk about, and being a musician who is interested largely in mathematics (or, as Vi Hart refers to herself, a "mathemusician") I feel obliged to write my own thoughts.

If I understand the first paragraph of the post correctly, {% m %} SSO \Delta {% em %} is in the quest of writing an algorithmic music composition program. I am also on the same quest, but I could say that I'm taking a different approach. Prepare yourself for a philosophical question: what kind of music do we expect the computer to compose?
