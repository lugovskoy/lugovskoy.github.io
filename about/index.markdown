title: About Me
---

Hi! My name is Berk Özbalcı. I'm a computer/math/music enthusiast living in İzmir, the west-end of Turkey. I attend Bornova Anatolian High School, and I'm in my third year.

I write code to make my life easier. I satisfy my philosophical desires with set theory and topology. I mostly listen to jazz, and some progressive rock once in a while. I also play the flute and the guitar.

This is my blog, sometimes I write. Sometimes I reblog the things I like. You can find me on a variety of social web sites, alphabetically:

* [GitHub][github] — code
* [Last.fm][lastfm] — my music
* [Twitter][twitter] — tweets

You can also send me [emails.][email]
