Hello, my name is Berk, I am a 17-year-old computer/math/music/etc. enthusiast living in İzmir, Turkey, currently a student of Bornova Anatolian High School. I like to spend my time on computers, working on programming and music.

I am interested in:

* hacking, Open Source, communities, etc.
* mathematics: nowadays focused on set theory.
* music: contemporary classical (I like to call this one "serious music"), avant-garde, jazz, progressive rock, art rock
* language learning
* vexillology
* philosophy
* debating
